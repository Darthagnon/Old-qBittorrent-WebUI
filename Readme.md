# Old QBittorrent WebUI

QBittorrent changed its program GUI and Web UI from perfectly functional icons to ugly childish icons with poor contrast.

**[Bluewave2's legacy-4.3.8-qBittorrent theme](https://github.com/Bluewave2/legacy-4.3.8-qBittorrent)** fixes the program GUI and reverts it to how it should be.

This project fixes the Web UI and reverts it to how it should be. 

To the misguided school of artists who designed QBittorrent's new icons, Windows 8, iOS 7, Metro and Fluent, as well as the modern web's p a d d i n g and whitespace, please leave well enough alone.

I based the theme off [QBittorrent v5.1.2](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/commit/3de2a9f486a77a911fab986daabbe50ce7c85b04), editing it with media from [QBittorrent v4.5.0alpha](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/tree/c47e29c7c8f6ffc4a86bcbfbf34e5b416f4d2569) which was the last commit prior to the ugly new icons.

Tested on [QBittorrent Enhanced Edition v4.6.7.10](https://github.com/c0re100/qBittorrent-Enhanced-Edition/releases/tag/release-4.6.7.10) (the last to work on Win7, with the [Oct 2024 RCE exploit](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42004219) patched).
